 @article{Chen, title={Improving scalability in systems neuroscience}, volume={109}, ISSN={08966273}, DOI={10.1016/j.neuron.2021.03.025}, abstractNote={Emerging technologies to acquire data at increasingly greater scales promise to transform discovery in systems neuroscience. However, current exponential growth in the scale of data acquisition is a double-edged sword. Scaling up data acquisition can speed up the cycle of discovery but can also misinterpret the results or possibly slow down the cycle because of challenges presented by the curse of high-dimensional data. Active, adaptive, closed-loop experimental paradigms use hardware and algorithms optimized to enable time-critical computation to provide feedback that interprets the observations and tests hypotheses to actively update the stimulus or stimulation parameters. In this perspective, we review important concepts of active and adaptive experiments and discuss how selectively constraining the dimensionality and optimizing strategies at different stages of discovery loop can help mitigate the curse of high-dimensional data. Active and adaptive closed-loop experimental paradigms can speed up discovery despite an exponentially increasing data scale, offering a road map to timely and iterative hypothesis revision and discovery in an era of exponential growth in neuroscience.}, number={11}, journal={Neuron}, author={Chen, Zhe Sage and Pesaran, Bijan}, year={2021}, month={Jun}, pages={1776–1790}, language={en} }

Brain–machine interfaces (BMIs) have the potential to augment human functions and restore independence in people with disabilities, yet a compromise between non-invasiveness and performance limits their relevance.               Approach.               Here, we hypothesized that a non-invasive neuromuscular–machine interface providing real-time neurofeedback of individual motor units within a muscle could enable independent motor unit control to an extent suitable for high-performance BMI applications.               Main results.               Over 6 days of training, eight participants progressively learned to skillfully and independently control three biceps brachii motor units to complete a 2D center-out task. We show that neurofeedback enabled motor unit activity that largely violated recruitment constraints observed during ramp-and-hold isometric contractions thought to limit individual motor unit controllability. Finally, participants demonstrated the suitability of individual motor units for powering general applications through a spelling task.               Significance.               These results illustrate the flexibility of the sensorimotor system and highlight individual motor units as a promising source of control for BMI applications.}, number={6}, journal={Journal of Neural Engineering}, author={Formento, Emanuele and Botros, Paul and Carmena, Jose M}, year={2021}, month={Dec}, pages={066019}, language={en} }
 @article{Ota, title={Fast, cell-resolution, contiguous-wide two-photon imaging to reveal functional network architectures across multi-modal cortical areas}, volume={109}, ISSN={08966273}, DOI={10.1016/j.neuron.2021.03.032}, abstractNote={Fast and wide ﬁeld-of-view imaging with single-cell resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio, and no optical aberrations have the potential to inspire new avenues of investigations in biology. However, such imaging is challenging because of the inevitable tradeoffs among these parameters. Here, we overcome these tradeoffs by combining a resonant scanning system, a large objective with low magniﬁcation and high numerical aperture, and highly sensitive large-aperture photodetectors. The result is a practically aberration-free, fast-scanning high optical invariant two-photon microscopy (FASHIO-2PM) that enables calcium imaging from a large network composed of $16,000 neurons at 7.5 Hz from a 9 mm2 contiguous image plane, including more than 10 sensory-motor and higher-order areas of the cerebral cortex in awake mice. Network analysis based on single-cell activities revealed that the brain exhibits small-world rather than scale-free behavior. The FASHIO-2PM is expected to enable studies on biological dynamics by simultaneously monitoring macroscopic activities and their compositional elements.}, number={11}, journal={Neuron}, author={Ota, Keisuke and Oisi, Yasuhiro and Suzuki, Takayuki and Ikeda, Muneki and Ito, Yoshiki and Ito, Tsubasa and Uwamori, Hiroyuki and Kobayashi, Kenta and Kobayashi, Midori and Odagawa, Maya and Matsubara, Chie and Kuroiwa, Yoshinori and Horikoshi, Masaru and Matsushita, Junya and Hioki, Hiroyuki and Ohkura, Masamichi and Nakai, Junichi and Oizumi, Masafumi and Miyawaki, Atsushi and Aonishi, Toru and Ode, Takahiro and Murayama, Masanori}, year={2021}, month={Jun}, pages={1810-1824.e9}, language={en} }

To address this need, we introduce the Neuropixels 2.0 probe together with newly designed analysis algorithms. The probe has more than 5000 sites and is miniaturized to facilitate chronic implants in small mammals and recording during unrestrained behavior. High-quality recordings over long time scales were reliably obtained in mice and rats in six laboratories. Improved site density and arrangement combined with newly created data processing methods enable automatic post hoc correction for brain movements, allowing recording from the same neurons for more than 2 months. These probes and algorithms enable stable recordings from thousands of sites during free behavior, even in small animals such as mice.}, number={6539}, journal={Science}, author={Steinmetz, Nicholas A. and Aydin, Cagatay and Lebedeva, Anna and Okun, Michael and Pachitariu, Marius and Bauza, Marius and Beau, Maxime and Bhagat, Jai and Böhm, Claudia and Broux, Martijn and Chen, Susu and Colonell, Jennifer and Gardner, Richard J. and Karsh, Bill and Kloosterman, Fabian and Kostadinov, Dimitar and Mora-Lopez, Carolina and O’Callaghan, John and Park, Junchol and Putzeys, Jan and Sauerbrei, Britton and van Daal, Rik J.
