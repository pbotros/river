River Installation
=====

For the C++ library and the ingester binary, installation via Conda is the preferred way:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge river-cpp
```
**NOTE: the ingester binary isn't available on Windows due to compilation issues. Use WSL or Linux/Mac for the ingester**.

For the Python bindings, conda is also preferred:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge river-py
```

For the (experimental) MATLAB bindings, see the MATLAB README for details.

For compiling from source, see further down.
